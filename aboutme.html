      <p>When I think about what excites me, two things come to mind: Computers and Soccer - Football for you purists =).  I can't think of a time in my life when either of these haven't been present or influenced me in some way. After what has felt like a decade (and realizing professional athletics wasn't a viable route - boohoo dreams!), I have decided to turn my passion of computing into a hopeful career. Throughout researching the many paths available, I stumbled upon programming and fell in love! I was destined to find a way to accelerate my learning to acquire the skills necessary to gain employment.  Long story short, I am now attending The Iron Yard with high hopes of acquiring the knowledge to turn this dream into a reality.

      This has been a long time coming but I have finally arrived. Cheers to new beginnings!
