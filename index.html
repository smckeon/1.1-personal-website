      <p>
      Whether referred to as Soccer or Football, the undeniable fact is every international club/team have their own unique playstyle based on their location.  From the brutal physicality of British club Manchester United to the mind games and possession base of Latin International team Spain, there is something to take away from every distinct region. To these areas, Soccer is not considered a sport; rather, it is a lifestyle.

<li><h3>British</h3></li>
  <div class="table">
    <p>
      <center>Players: <i>Physical, Quick, Direct</i></center>
        <br>
          <strong>Characteristics:</strong> The no-nonsense British style incorporates a lot of traditional values that have been present in England since the emergence of football. Attacks
          are set up quickly and with few touches. This fast-pace mentality often leads to
          fierce fighting over 50-50 balls. Passes are direct, often sent over the defense
          and crosses are served from any situation.
          <br>
          <strong>Success:</strong> In the modern game, English club teams have generally struggled in
          international competition. Manchester United and Chelsea are exceptions although
          both clubs play a completely different game outside of England. More recently,
          the country has been trying to adopt a more continental approach and the FA has
          even appointed a foreign manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson.

<li><h3>Italian</h3></li>
  <div class="table">
    <p>
      <center>Players: <i>Skillful, Cunning, Cautious</i></center>
        <br>
          <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Italian teams are very cautious about the number of players
          they are committing forward. Players use a variety of skills and the tempo
          changes often during buildup. Attackers make runs at indirect angles which
          is unpredictable and difficult to contain. Defenders prefer to slow down the
          tempo by shielding and playing the ball back. Most Italian teams like to
          saturate their own half and shut down their opposition
        <br>
      <strong>Success:</strong> Italian clubs have had a dominant presence in European competition.
      Clubs like Milan, Juventus, Roma and Inter have been very successful.
    </div>
  </p>


<li><h3>Latin</h3></li>
  <div class="table">
    <p>
      <center>Players: <i>Confident with the ball, Good Dribblers, Creative</i></center>
        <br>
          <strong>Characteristics:</strong> The Latin game is very distinctive because of its
          possession-oriented character. Attacks are developed through possession.
          The ball is moved spontaneously with a lot of individual-based plays.
          Latin teams such as Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Argentina are typical examples.
          Brazil takes this style to the extreme through improvisational and free-flowing movement.
          <br>
      <strong>Success:</strong> Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, and Spain are the leading forces
      when it comes to the Latin style. Spanish clubs have been very dominant
      in Europe while Brazil’s national squad has dominated in the World Cup.

<li><h3>Northern</h3></li>
  <div class="table">
    <p>
      <center>Players: <i>Aggressive, Fast, Organized</i></center>
        <br>
          <strong>Characteristics:</strong> The game is played in a very direct way with forceful,
          although predictable attacks. In defense, a definite shape is always preserved.
          Players have very specific roles within their team and rarely improvise.
          Northern teams, such as Germany or Sweden, either keep possession or attack
          by hammering forward. There is no in between.
            <br>
          <strong>Success:</strong> Germany is a powerful side and has been representing the
          Northern style for years. Germany is a powerful side and has been
          representing the Northern style for years. Although it may not always
          look attractive, the Northern style can be quite effective.

<li><h3>Continental</h3></li>
  <div class="table">
    <p>
      <center>Players: <i>Good Passing, Collectivists</i></center>
        <br>
          <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Plays are developed with creativity yet there is a sense of
          composure and team coordination. Positioning is not very strict so there is
          plenty of movement without the ball in order to accommodate.
          <br>
          <strong>Success:</strong> Holland’s total football has revolutionized the game and the
          collectivist mentality is the essence of what is considered the
          “continental” style. The style has been successfully adopted by many
          other European countries.
      </div>
    </p>


<li><h3>Central American</h3></li>
  <div class="table">
    <p>
      <center>Players: <i>Crafty, Excessive Dribblers</i></center>
        <br>
          <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Most of the time, the ball is moved around with short
          passes and a lot of dribbling. Virtually all players have good 1v1 skills.
          Players rarely make quick runs. Overall, the tempo is slow during buildup
          except for the occasional and unexpected long, forward pass.
        <br>
      <strong>Success:</strong> Mexico is probably the only noteworthy representative of this
      style of football.
